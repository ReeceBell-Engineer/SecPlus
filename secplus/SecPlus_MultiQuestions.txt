Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) - CRCs are similar in concept to checksums, but they use polynomial division to determine the value of the CRC, which is usually 16 or 32 bits in length. The good thing about CRC is that it is very accurate. If a single bit is incorrect, the CRC value will not match up. Both checksum and CRC are good for preventing random errors in transmission but provide little ...

B. laaS
C. HSMaaS 
D. PaaS
E. Key Management Service

Answer: C

HSM as a Service: secure and convenient
HSM as a Service (HSMaaS) is an alternative to HSM devices and KMS. HSMaaS provides secure, centralized key management and cryptography without the need for HSM appliances. Its on-demand implementation simplifies the provisioning and control of encryption keys. An added benefit of the HSMaaS approach is the ability to maintain encryption keys separate from the data they protect, thereby providing an additional level of data security.
HSM or KMS or HSM as a Service: What drives the decision?
In our discussions with businesses developing or evaluating an encryption key management for cloud strategy we’ve worked with every size organization at every level of the maturity curve—small businesses proactively working to improve data security, cloud-born startups, organizations with hybrid cloud architectures and global organizations wrestling with the complexity of complying with varying regulations such as GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). In advising these businesses on their encryption key management strategy we’ve discovered several common reasons for choosing HSM as a Service over HSMs or KMS.

Joe, an employee, is transferring departments and is providing copies of his files to a network share folder for his previous team to access. Joe is granting read-write-execute permissions to his manager but giving read-only access to the rest of the team. Which of the following access controls is Joe using?

A. FACL 
B. DAC 
C. ABAC 
D. MAC

Answer: B

Discretionary access control (DAC) is based on the primacy of the resource owner. The owner is originally the creator 
of a file or service, though ownership can be assigned to another user. The owner is granted full control over the resource, meaning that he or she can modify its access control list (ACL) to grant rights to others.

The file permissions according to the file system access control list (FACL) are rw-rw-r–.
The first ‘rw-‘ are the file owner permissions (read and write).
The second ‘rw-‘ are the group permissions (read and write) for the group that has been assigned the file.
The third ‘r–‘ is the All Users permissions; in this case read only.

Which of the following has MOST likely occurred?

A. Replay attack 
B. SQL injection 
C. SSL stripping 
D. Race conditions

Answer: C

A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) stripping attack changes a Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connection to a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) connection. HTTPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) instead of SSL in almost all instances, so you can also think of this as TLS stripping. HTTPS sessions are encrypted, so data sent within a session is unreadable. However, the session is not encrypted until TLS sets up the session. If an attacker can intercept the beginning 
of the TLS negotiation, the attacker can redirect the user to an HTTP page instead of an HTTPS page.

A company's help desk received several AV alerts indicating Mimikatz attempted to run on the remote systems. Several users also reported that the new company flash drives they picked up in the break room only have 512KB of storage. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause?

A. The GPO prevents the use of flash drives, which triggers a false positive AV indication and restricts the drives to only 512KB of storage.
B. The new flash drives need a driver that is being blocked by the AV software because the flash drives are not on the application's allow list, temporarily restricting the drives to 512KB of storage.
C. The new flash drives are incorrectly partitioned, and the systems are automatically trying to use an unapproved application to repartition the drives.
D. The GPO blocking the flash drives is being bypassed by a malicious flash drive that is attempting to harvest plaintext credentials from memory.

Answer: D

Mimikatz is a credential dumping open source program used to obtain account login and password information, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from an operating system or software. Credentials can then be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.
Mimikatz is a Windows x32/x64 program to extract passwords, hash, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory.  It is used as an attack tool against Windows clients, allowing the extraction of cleartext passwords and password hashes from memory.

Several large orders of merchandise were recently purchased on an e-commerce company's website. 
The totals for each of the transactions were negative values, resulting in credits on the customers' accounts. 
Which of the following should be implemented to prevent similar situations in the future?

A. Ensure input validation is in place to prevent the use of invalid characters and values.
B. Calculate all possible values to be added together and ensure the use of the proper integer in the code.
C. Configure the web application firewall to look for and block session replay attacks.
D. Make sure transactions that are submitted within very short time periods are prevented from being processed.

Answer: B

An integer overflow occurs if an application receives a numeric value that is too big for the application to handle. The result is that the application gives inaccurate results. As an example, if an application reserves 8 bits to store a number, it can store any value between 0 and 255. If the application attempts to multiply two values, such as 95 × 59, and store the result (5,605) in an 8-bit memory location, it causes an integer overflow. It’s a good practice to double-check the size of memory buffers to ensure they can handle any data generated by applications. It’s also possible to use input validation techniques to prevent integer overflow issues. If the application doesn’t have adequate error- and exception-handling routines, this might cause an integer overflow condition.

An integer is a positive or negative number with no fractional component (a whole number). Integers are widely used as a data type, where they are commonly defined with fixed lower and upper bounds. An integer overflow attack causes the target
software to calculate a value that exceeds these bounds. This may cause a positive number to become negative (changing a bank debit to a credit, for instance). It could also be used where the software is calculating a buffer size; if the attacker is able to make the buffer smaller than it should be, he or she may then be able to launch a buffer overflow attack.

A security analyst has been reading about a newly discovered cyberattack from a known threat actor. 
Which of the following would BEST support the analyst's review of the tactics, techniques, and protocols the threat actor was observed using in previous campaigns?

A. Security research publications 
B. The MITRE ATT&CK framework
C. The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis 
D. The Cyber Kill Chain

Answer: B

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a knowledge base of tactics and techniques used in real-world attacks. The knowledge base is presented in a matrix or table format. Tactics represent the adversary’s tactical objective for performing an action or why the adversary is doing what he’s doing. The techniques document how an adversary achieves a tactical objective or what the adversary gains by performing an action.

The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis focuses on understanding the attacker by analyzing four key components of every intrusion event. These four components are: 

Adversary. Adversaries can be identified by email addresses, handles used in online forums,  memberships in advanced persistent threat groups, and other identifiers. 

Capabilities. Capabilities refer to the malware, exploits, and other hacker tools used in the intrusion.

Infrastructure. The infrastructure refers to the Internet domain names, email addresses, and IP addresses used by the adversary.

Victim. Victims can be identified by their names, email addresses, or network identifiers.

Cyber Kill Chain - Scientists at Lockheed-Martin identified an intrusion kill chain with the following elements performed in order from start to finish: 

Reconnaissance. This includes researching, identifying, and selecting targets.

Weaponization. Malware, such as a remote access Trojan (RAT), is embedded within a deliverable payload, such as an infected Microsoft Office document.

Delivery. The payload is transmitted to the target. Malware is often delivered as an attachment within a phishing email.

Exploitation. After the weapon is delivered, it activates and triggers the exploit. Exploits often target an application or operating system vulnerability.

Most of the cloud services we have considered so far are "user-facing." They support applications that human users interact with, such as video streaming, CRM, business analytics, email and conferencing, endpoint protection analytics, and so on. However,
a very large and increasing amount of cloud data processing takes place with data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors. Industrial processes and even home automation are availability-focused. While confidentiality and integrity are
still important concerns, service interruption in an operational technology network can be physically dangerous. Consequently, there is a strong requirement to retrieve and analyze IoT data with low latency. A traditional data center architecture does not meet this requirement very well. Sensors are quite likely to have relatively low-bandwidth, higher latency WAN links to
data networks. Sensors may generate huge quantities of data only a selection of which needs to be prioritized for analysis. 
Fog computing, developed by Cisco (cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/solutions/trends/iot/docs/computing-overview.pdf), addresses these requirements by placing fog node processing resources close to the physical location for the IoT sensors. The sensors communicate with the fog node, using Wi-Fi, ZigBee, or 4G/5G, and the fog node prioritizes traffic, analyzes and remediates alertable conditions, and backhauls remaining data to the data center for storage and low-priority analysis.

QUESTION 352
A financial institution would like to store its customer data in the cloud but still allow the data to be accessed and manipulated while encrypted. Doing so would prevent the cloud service provider from being able to decipher the data due to its sensitivity. The financial institution is not concerned about computational overheads and slow speeds.
Which of the following cryptographic techniques would BEST meet the requirement?

A. Asymmetric 
B. Symmetric
C. Homomorphic
1D. Ephemeral

Answer: C

Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that permits users to perform computations on its encrypted data without first decrypting it. These resulting computations are left in an encrypted form which, when decrypted, result in an identical output to that produced had the operations been performed on the unencrypted data. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation. This allows data to be encrypted and out-sourced to commercial cloud environments for processing, all while encrypted.

Which of the following often operates in a client-server architecture to act as a service repository providing enterprise consumers access to structured threat intelligence data?

A. STIX 
B. CIRT 
C. OSINT 
D. TAXII

Answer: D

The Structured Threat Information eXpression, or STIX, is an XML structured language for expressing and sharing threat intelligence.

Which of the following would a European company interested in implementing a technical, hands-on set of security standards MOST likely choose?

A. GDPR
B. CIS controls 
C. ISO 27001 
D. ISO 37000

Answer: A

GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation - Where some types of legislation address cybersecurity due diligence, others focus in whole or in part on information security as it affects privacy or personal data. Privacy is a distinct concept from security. Privacy requires that collection and processing of personal information be both secure and fair. Fairness and the right to privacy, as enacted by regulations such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), means that personal data cannot be collected, processed, or retained without the individual's informed consent. Informed consent means that the
data must be collected and processed only for the stated purpose, and that purpose must be clearly described to the user in plain language, not legalese.

The Center for Internet Security (cisecurity.org) is a not-for-profit organization (founded partly by The SANS Institute). It publishes the well-known "The 20 CIS Controls." The CIS-RAM (Risk Assessment Method) can be used to perform an overall
evaluation of security posture (learn.cisecurity.org/cis-ram). CIS also produces benchmarks for different aspects of cybersecurity. For example, there are benchmarks for compliance with IT frameworks and compliance programs, such as PCI DSS, NIST 800-53, SOX, and ISO 27000. There are also product-focused benchmarks, such as for Windows Desktop, Windows Server, macOS, Linux, Cisco, web browsers, web servers, database and email servers, and VMware ESXi. The CIS-CAT (Configuration
Access Tool) can be used with automated vulnerability scanners to test compliance
against these benchmarks (cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-tools/cis-cat-pro/cis-cat-faq).

A Chief Security Officer (CSO) is concerned about the volume and integrity of sensitive information that is exchanged between the organization and a third party through email. The CSO is particularly concerned about an unauthorized party who is intercepting information that is in transit between the two organizations. Which of the following would address the CSO's concerns?

A. SPF
B. DMARC 
C. SSL
D. DKIM 
E. TLS

Answer: E
DKIM is one of a trio of Authentication methods (SPF, DKIM and DMARC) that help prevent attackers from sending messages that look like they come from your domain.
DKIM lets you add a digital signature to outbound email messages in the message header. When you configure DKIM, you authorize your domain to associate, or sign, its name to an email message using cryptographic authentication. Email systems that get email from your domain can use this digital signature to help verify whether incoming email is legitimate.
In basic, a private key encrypts the header in a domain's outgoing email. The public key is published in the domain's DNS records, and receiving servers can use that key to decode the signature. DKIM verification helps the receiving servers confirm the mail is really coming from your domain and not someone spoofing your domain.
DMARC is an email authentication protocol. It is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use, commonly known as email spoofing. The purpose and primary outcome of implementing DMARC is to protect a domain from being used in business email compromise attacks, phishing emails, email scams and other cyber threat activities.

Entering a secure area requires passing through two doors, both of which require someone who is already inside to initiate access. Which of the following types of physical security controls does this describe?

A. Cameras
B. Faraday cage
C. Access control vestibule 
D. Sensors
E. Guards

Answer: C

An access control vestibule (sometimes called a mantrap) prevents tailgating. It is a room, or even a building, with two doors that creates a large buffer area between the secure and unsecured areas. Access through the entry door, and the exit door is tightly controlled, either with guards or with an access card such as a proximity card. Security guards can check each person’s credentials, and they won’t be fooled by a smile as easily as Francesca might fool Homer. A simple turnstile, like those used in subways or bus stations, also prevents tailgating. Imagine two men trying to go through a turnstile like this together. It’s just not likely.

A security administrator has noticed unusual activity occurring between different global instances and workloads and needs to identify the source of the unusual traffic. Which of the following log sources would be BEST to show the source of the unusual traffic?

A. HIDS
B. UEBA 
C. CASB 
D. VPC

Answer: B

User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) is a cybersecurity solution that uses algorithms and machine learning to detect anomalies in the behavior of not only the users in a corporate network but also the routers, servers, and endpoints in that network.
UEBA seeks to recognize any peculiar or suspicious behavior—instances where there are irregularities from normal everyday patterns or usage. For example, if a particular user on the network regularly downloads files of 20 MB every day but starts downloading 4 GB of files, the UEBA system would consider this an anomaly and either alert an IT administrator, or if automations are in place, automatically disconnect that user from the network. 
UEBA goes further than simply monitoring human behavior—it monitors machines. A server in one branch office may suddenly receive thousands more requests than usual one day, signaling the start of a potential distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. There is a chance IT administrators might not notice this type of activity, but UEBA would recognize it and take further action.

During a security assessment, an analyst finds a file with overly permissive permissions. Which of the following tools will allow the analyst to reduce the permission for the existing users and groups and remove the set-user-ID from the file?

A. ls -l 
B. chflags 
C. chmod 
D. setuid

Answer: C

What is Setuid? (computerhope.com)
Setuid, which stands for set user ID on execution, is a special type of file permission in Unix and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and BSD. It is a security tool that permits users to run certain programs with escalated privileges.
When an executable file's setuid permission is set, users may execute that program with a level of access that matches the user who owns the file. For instance, when a user wants to change their password, they run the passwd command. The passwd program is owned by the root account and marked as setuid, so the user is temporarily granted root access for that limited purpose.
> Viewing the setuid permission of a file.
> Setting the setuid permission of a file.
> Setgid.
> Related pages.
Viewing the setuid permission of a file
When viewing a file's permissions with the ls -l command, the setuid permission is displayed as an "s" in the "user execute" bit position. For example:
ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root 54192 Nov 20 17:03 /usr/bin/passwd
Setting the setuid permission of a file
To set the setuid permission for an executable file, use the permission identifier u+s with the chmod command:
chmod u+s myfile

QUESTION 402
The spread of misinformation surrounding the outbreak of a novel virus on election day led to
8eligible voters choosing not to take the risk of going to the polls. This is an example of:

A. prepending.
B. an influence campaign 
C. a watering-hole attack 
D. intimidation
E. information elicitation

Answer: B

An influence campaign is a major program launched by an adversary with a high level of capability, such as a nation-state actor, terrorist group, or hacktivist group. The goal of an influence campaign is to shift public opinion on some topic. Most high-profile
influence campaigns that have been detected target election activity, but actors may use such campaigns to pursue a number of goals.

phishing or hoax email can be made more convincing by prepending. In an offensive sense, prepending means adding text that appears to have been generated by the mail system. For example, an attacker may add "RE:" to the subject line to make it appear
as though the message is a reply or may add something like "MAILSAFE: PASSED" to make it appear as though a message has been scanned and accepted by some security software.

The classic impersonation attack is for the social engineer to phone into a department, claim they have to adjust something on the user's system remotely, and get the user to reveal their password. This specific attack is also referred to as pretexting.

A. Request forgery 
B. Session replay 
C. DLL injection
D. Shimming

Answer: C

DLL Injection and Driver Manipulation
A dynamic link library (DLL) is a binary package that implements some sort of standard functionality, such as establishing a network connection or performing cryptography. The main process of a software application is likely to load several DLLs during the normal course of operations.

DLL injection is a vulnerability in the way the operating system allows one process to attach to another. This functionality can be abused by malware to force a legitimate process to load a malicious link library. The link library will contain whatever functions
the malware author wants to be able to run. Malware uses this technique to move from one host process to another to avoid detection. A process that has been compromised by DLL injection might open unexpected network connections, or interact with files and the registry suspiciously. To perform DLL injection the malware must already be operating with sufficient privileges, typically local administrator or system privileges. It must also evade detection by antivirus software. One means of doing this is code refactoring.

Refactoring means that the code performs the same function by using different methods (control blocks, variable types, and so on). Refactoring means that the A-V software may no longer identify the malware by its signature.

A security researcher is tracking an adversary by noting its attack and techniques based on its capabilities, infrastructure, and victims. Which of the following is the researcher MOST likely using?

A. The Diamond Model of intrusion Analysis 
B. The Cyber Kill Chain\
C. The MITRE CVE database
D. The incident response process

Answer: A

The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis focuses on understanding the attacker by analyzing four key components of every intrusion event. These four components are: 

Adversary - Adversaries can be identified by email addresses, handles used in online forums, memberships in advanced persistent threat groups, and other identifiers. 

Capabilities - Capabilities refer to the malware, exploits, and other hacker tools used in the intrusion.

Infrastructure - The infrastructure refers to the Internet domain names, email addresses, and IP addresses used by the adversary.

Victim - Victims can be identified by their names, email addresses, or network identifiers.

It starts with the idea that every intrusion event has an adversary that uses a capability across an infrastructure against a victim. These core components can be mapped to different phases of a cyber kill chain. The same adversary performs reconnaissance, delivers a weapon, exploits a vulnerability, and so on through the cyber kill chain. The capabilities, infrastructure, and victim may change within the kill chain, but the adversary remains the same. For example, the capability at the delivery stage may be malware delivered via a phishing email. The capability at the installation stage may be a malicious script that creates a backdoor. By analyzing these components in multiple attacks, it reveals similarities. For example, an attack against BizzFad might have the same components as an attack against Monstromart. This knowledge gives cybersecurity professionals insight into possible future attacks, and they can disrupt the kill chain.

Cyber Kill Chain - Historically, kill chain has been a military concept related to an attack. It starts with the identification of a target, dispatching resources to the target, someone deciding to attack and giving the order, and it ends with the destruction of the target. Military personnel attempt to break an opponent’s kill chain, such as by disrupting communication methods. The cyber kill chain is similar. Scientists at Lockheed-Martin identified an intrusion kill chain with the following elements performed in order from start to finish: 

Reconnaissance - This includes researching, identifying, and selecting targets.

Weaponization - Malware, such as a remote access Trojan (RAT), is embedded within a deliverable payload, such as an infected Microsoft Office document.

Delivery - The payload is transmitted to the target. Malware is often delivered as an attachment within a phishing email.

Exploitation - After the weapon is delivered, it activates and triggers the exploit. Exploits often target an application or operating system vulnerability.

Installation - The exploit will often install a remote access Trojan or a backdoor on the attacked system. This allows the attacker to maintain persistence inside the exploited environment.

Command and Control (C2) - Infected systems often send out a beacon to an Internet-based server. This establishes the C2 channel, giving attackers full access to the infected system.

Actions on Objectives - At this point, attackers can begin taking action to achieve their ultimate goals. It could be installing ransomware or collecting, encrypting, and extracting data from the infected environment.

By understanding the intrusion kill chain, it becomes a little easier to identify ways to disrupt it.

QUESTION 448
A security analyst must enforce policies to harden a MOM (Message orientated Middleware) infrastructure. 
The requirements are as follows:

- Ensure mobile devices can be traded and wiped. 
- Confirm mobile devices are encrypted.

Which of the following should the analyst enable on all the devices to meet these requirements?

A. Geofencing
B. Biometric authentication
C. Geolocation 
D. Geotagging

Answer: C

Message-oriented middleware is software or hardware infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between distributed systems. MOM allows application modules to be distributed over heterogeneous platforms and reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple operating systems and network protocols. The middleware creates a distributed communications layer that insulates the application developer from the details of the various operating systems and network interfaces. APIs that extend across diverse platforms and networks are typically provided by MOM.

> Geolocation - Mobile devices commonly include GPS capabilities that are used for geolocation. Applications commonly use GPS to identify the location of the device and device movement. GPS can also be used to locate a lost device. 

> Geofencing - Organizations sometimes use GPS to create a virtual fence or geographic boundary using geofencing technologies. Apps can respond when the device is within the virtual fence. As an example, an organization can configure mobile apps so that they will only run when the device is within the virtual fence. Similarly, an organization can configure a wireless network to only operate for mobile devices within the defined boundary. 

> GPS tagging - GPS tagging (also called geotagging) adds geographical information to files such as pictures when posting them to social media websites. For example, when you take a picture with a smartphone with GPS features enabled, the picture application adds latitude and longitude coordinates to the picture.

Which two features are available only in next-generation firewalls? (Choose two )

A. deep packet inspection 
B. packet filtering
C. application awareness 
D. stateful inspection
E. virtual private network

Answer: AC

A next-generation firewall (NGFW) is an advanced firewall that adds capabilities that aren’t available in first-generation or second-generation firewalls. The first generation of firewalls were packet-filtering firewalls, using stateless firewall rules, and could only allow or block traffic after evaluating individual packets. The second generation of firewalls added in stateful firewall rules. This allows firewalls to evaluate traffic based on its session state. Firewalls have steadily improved over the years, and if each improvement was labeled as another generation, we might be on the ninety-ninth generation. Thankfully, we’re just using
NGFW to indicate that a firewall adds additional capabilities to first- and second-generation firewalls. An NGFW performs deep-packet inspection, adding application-level inspection as a core feature. The NGFW is aware of common application protocols used on the Internet, such as FTP and HTTP. By using deep-packet inspection, the NGFW can identify application commands and detect potentially malicious traffic. This allows it to apply content filtering and URL filtering.

Which of the following should a technician consider when selecting an encryption method for data that needs 
to remain confidential for a specific length of time?

A. The key length of the encryption algorithm 
B. The encryption algorithm’s longevity
C. A method of introducing entropy into key calculations
D. The computational overhead of calculating the encryption key

Answer: C

Entropy and Weak Keys Entropy is a measure of disorder. A plaintext will usually exhibit low entropy as it represents a 
message in a human language or programming language or data structure. The plaintext must be ordered for it to be 
intelligible to a person, computer processor, or database. One of the requirements of a strong cryptographic algorithm 
is to produce a disordered ciphertext. Put another way, the ciphertext must exhibit a high level of entropy. If any 
elements of order from the plaintext persist, it will make the ciphertext vulnerable to cryptanalysis, and the algorithm 
can be shown to be weak.

Answer: B

https://medium.com/code-kings/linux-ubuntu-how-to-use-ssh-config-to-simplify-scp-commands-48f464acfa82


SSH Commands SSH commands are used to connect to hosts and set up authentication methods. To connect to an SSH server at 10.1.0.10 using an account named "bobby" and password authentication, run: 

ssh bobby@10.1.0.10 
The following commands create a new key pair and copy it to an account on the remote server: 

ssh-keygen -t rsa 
ssh-copy-id bobby@10.1.0.10 

At an SSH prompt, you can now use the standard Linux shell commands. Use exit to close the connection. You can also use the scp command to copy a file from the remote server to the local host: 

scp bobby@10.1.0.10:/logs/audit.log audit.log Reverse the arguments to copy a file from the local host to the remote server. To copy the contents of a directory and any subdirectories (recursively), use the -r option.

Network configuration is the process of assigning network settings, policies, flows, and controls. In a virtual network, it's easier to make network configuration changes because physical network devices appliances are replaced by software, removing the need for extensive manual configuration.

QUESTION 513
As part of a company's ongoing SOC maturation process, the company wants to implement a method to share cyberthreat intelligence data with outside security partners. Which of the following will the company MOST likely implement?

1A. TAXII 
B. DLP 
C. TTP 
D. STIX

Answer: A 

Threat Data Feeds
When you use a cyber threat intelligence (CTI) platform, you subscribe to a threat data feed. The information in the threat data can be combined with event data from your own network and system logs. An analysis platform performs correlation to detect
whether any IoCs are present. There are various ways that a threat data feed can be implemented.

Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)
The OASIS CTI framework (oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation) is designed to provide a format for this type of automated feed so that organizations can share CTI.

 The Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) part of the framework describes standard terminology for IoCs and ways of indicating relationships between them.

Where STIX provides the syntax for describing CTI, the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) protocol provides a means for transmitting CTI data between servers and clients. For example, a CTI service provider would maintain a repository of CTI data. Subscribers to the service obtain updates to the data to load into analysis tools over TAXII. This data can be requested by the client (referred to as a collection), or the data can be pushed to subscribers (referred to as a channel).

TTPs Within Cyber Threat Intelligence
Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) are the "patterns of activities or methods associated with a specific threat actor or group of threat actors." Analysis of TTPs aids in counterintelligence and security operations by describing how threat actors perform attacks.
Top threats facing an organization should be given priority for TTP maturation. Smaller organizations may benefit strategically by outsourcing research and response. One acronym everyone working on a cybersecurity team should be familiar with is TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) but not everyone understands how to use them properly within a cyber threat intelligence solution. TTPs describe how threat actors (the bad guys) orchestrate, execute and manage their operations attacks. ("Tactics" is also sometimes called "tools" in the acronym.) Specifically, TTPs are defined as the "patterns of activities or methods associated with a specific threat actor or group of threat actors," according to the Definitive Guide to Cyber Threat Intelligence.

A security analyst is concerned about critical vulnerabilities that have been detected on some applications running inside containers. Which of the following is the BEST remediation strategy?

A. Update the base container image and redeploy the environment. 
B. Include the containers in the regular patching schedule for servers 
C. Patch each running container individually and test the application 
D. Update the host in which the containers are running

Answer: A 

A container image vulnerability is a security risk that is embedded inside a container image. While vulnerable images themselves don't pose an active threat, if containers are created based on a vulnerable image, the containers will introduce the vulnerability to a live environment.

QUESTION 515 
A security analyst is investigating multiple hosts that are communicating to external IP addresses during the hours of 2:00am - 4:00 am. The malware has evaded detection by traditional antivirus software. Which of the following types of malware is MOST likely infecting the hosts?

A. A RAT
B. Ransomware 
C. Logic bomb 
D. A worm

Answer: A

A remote access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows attackers to take control of systems from remote locations. It is often delivered via drive-by downloads. Once installed on a system, attackers can then access the infected computer at any time, and install additional malware if desired. Some RATs automatically collect and log keystrokes, usernames and
passwords, incoming and outgoing email, chat sessions, and browser history as well as take screenshots. The RAT can then automatically send the data to the attackers at predetermined times.

QUESTION 516
The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has decided to reorganize security staff to concentrate on incident response 
and to outsource outbound Internet URL categorization and filtering to an outside company. Additionally, the CISO would like 
this solution to provide the same protections even when a company laptop or mobile device is away from a home office. 
Which of the following should the CISO choose?

A. CASB
B. Next-generation SWG 
C. NGFW
D. Web-application firewall

Answer: B

A cloud access security broker (CASB) is on-premises or cloud based software that sits between cloud service users and cloud applications, and monitors all activity and enforces security policies.[1] A CASB can offer services such as monitoring user activity, warning administrators about potentially hazardous actions, enforcing security policy compliance, and automatically preventing malware.

Enterprise networks often make use of secure web gateways (SWG). An on-premises SWG is a proxy-based firewall, content filter, and intrusion detection/prevention system that mediates user access to Internet sites and services. A next-generation
SWG, as marketed by Netskope (netskope.com/products/next-gen-swg), combines the functionality of an SWG with that of data loss prevention (DLP) and a CASB to provide a wholly cloud-hosted platform for client access to websites and cloud apps.
This supports an architecture defined by Gartner as secure access service edge (SASE) (scmagazine.com/home/opinion/secure-access-service-edge-sase-key-points-for-earlyadopters)

A Web-application firewall (WAF) protects your web apps by filtering, monitoring, and blocking any malicious HTTP/S traffic traveling to the web application, and prevents any unauthorized data from leaving the app. It does this by adhering to a set of policies that help determine what traffic is malicious and what traffic is safe.

QUESTION 542
A security engineer needs to build a solution to satisfy regulatory requirements that state certain critical servers must be accessed using MFA. However, the critical servers are older and are unable to support the addition of MFA.
Which of the following will the engineer MOST likely use to achieve this objective?

A. A forward proxy 		
B. A stateful firewall 
C. A jump server
D. A port tap

Answer: C

A stateful firewall inspects traffic and makes decisions based on the traffic context or state. It keeps track of established sessions, inspects traffic based on its state within a session, and it blocks traffic that isn’t part of an established session. As an example, a TCP session starts with a three-way handshake. If a stateful firewall detects TCP traffic without a corresponding three-way handshake, it recognizes this as suspicious traffic and can block it.

A port tap or port mirror on the internal switch. Most switches support port mirroring (sometimes called port spanning), allowing administrators to configure the switch to send all traffic the switch receives to a single port. After configuring a port mirror, you can use it as a tap to send all switch data to a sensor or collector and forward this to a NIDS console. Similarly, it’s possible to configure port taps on routers to capture all traffic sent through the router and send it to the IDS.

One of the challenges of managing hosts that are exposed to the Internet, such as in a DMZ or cloud virtual network, is to provide administrative access to the servers and appliances located within it. On the one hand, a link is necessary; on the other, the
administrative interface could be compromised and exploited as a pivot point into the rest of the network. Consequently, the management hosts permitted to access administrative interfaces on hosts in the secure zone must be tightly controlled.
Configuring and auditing this type of control when there are many different servers
operating in the zone is complex. One solution to this complexity is to add a single administration server, or jump server, 
to the secure zone. The jump server only runs the necessary administrative port and protocol (typically SSH or RDP). Administrators connect to the jump server then use the jump server to connect to the admin interface on the application server.
The application server's admin interface has a single entry in its ACL (the jump server) and denies connection attempts from any other hosts.

A security analyst receives an alert from the company's SIEM that anomalous activity is coming from a local source IP address of 192.168.34.26. The Chief Information Security Officer asks the analyst to block the originating source. Several days later another employee opens an internal ticket stating that vulnerability scans are no longer being performed properly. The IP address the employee provides is 192.168.34.26. Which of the following describes this type of alert?

A. True positive 
B. True negative 
C. False positive 
D. False negative

Answer: C 

Traditional SIEM Log Analysis
Traditionally, the SIEM used two techniques to generate alerts from log data: correlation rules, specifying a sequence of events that indicates an anomaly, which could represent a security threat, vulnerability or active security incident; and vulnerabilities and risk assessment, which involves scanning networks for known attack patterns and vulnerabilities. The drawback of these older techniques is that they generate a lot of false positives, and are not successful at detecting new and unexpected event types

A software company is analyzing a process that detects software vulnerabilities at the earliest stage possible. 
The goal is to scan the source looking for unsecure practices and weaknesses before the application is deployed in a runtime environment. Which of the following would BEST assist the company with this objective?

A. Use fuzzing testing
B. Use a web vulnerability scanner 
C. Use static code analysis
D. Use a penetration-testing OS

Answer: C 

Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks.


Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software performed without executing any programs, in contrast with dynamic analysis, which is performed on programs during their execution.
What is static code analysis?

Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run. It's done by analyzing a set of code against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules. ... This type of analysis addresses weaknesses in source code that might lead to vulnerabilities.

A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test or ethical hacking, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system; this is not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment.

QUESTION 549
A company is providing security awareness training regarding the importance of not forwarding social media messages from unverified sources. Which of the following risks would this training help to prevent?

A. Hoaxes 
B. SPIMs
C. Identity fraud
D. Credential harvesting

Answer: A

A hoax is a falsehood deliberately fabricated to masquerade as the truth. It is distinguishable from errors in observation or judgment, rumors, urban legends, pseudo sciences, and April Fools' Day events that are passed along in good faith by believers or as jokes.
Identity theft occurs when someone uses another person's personal identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term identity theft was coined in 1964. Identity fraud (also known as identity theft or crime) involves someone using another individual's personal information without consent, often to obtain a benefit.

Credential Harvesting (or Account Harvesting) is the use of MITM attacks, DNS poisoning, phishing, and other vectors to amass large numbers of credentials (username / password combinations) for reuse.

A penetration tester was able to compromise an internal server and is now trying to pivot the current session in a network lateral movement. Which of the following tools, if available on the server, will provide the MOST useful information for the next assessment step?

A. Autopsy 
B. Cuckoo
C. Memdump 
D. Nmap

Answer: D 

Memdump
A display or printout of all or selected contents of RAM. After a program abends (crashes), a memory dump is taken in order to analyze the status of the program. The programmer looks into the memory buffers to see which data items were being worked on at the time of failure.

Nmap
Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

Cuckoo Sandbox is an open-source automated software analysis system. Its primary purpose is to analyze suspicious files, such as suspected malware. Unlike malware that analyzes files in real-time, you need to submit files to Cuckoo Sandbox. Cuckoo then runs it in a virtual machine (VM) and creates a report on its activity.

A. SLA 
B. AUP 
C. NDA 
D. BIA

Answer: D 

To create an effective business continuity plan, a firm should take these five steps: 
Step 1: Risk Assessment
This phase includes:
Evaluation of the company's risks and exposures
Assessment of the potential impact of various business disruption scenarios.
Determination of the most likely threat scenarios.
Assessment of telecommunication recovery options and communication plans. 
Prioritization of findings and development of a roadmap.

Step 2: Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
During this phase we collect information on:
Recovery assumptions, including Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
Critical business processes and workflows as well as the supporting production applications Interdependencies, both internal and external
Critical staff including backups, skill sets, primary and secondary contacts Future endeavors that may impact recovery
Special circumstances
Pro tip: Compiling your BIA into a master list can be helpful from a wholistic standpoint, as well as helpful in identifying pain points throughout the organization.

Step 3: Business Continuity Plan Development 
This phase includes:
Obtaining executive sign-off of Business Impact Analysis Synthesizing the Risk Assessment and BIA findings to create an actionable and thorough plan
Developing department, division and site level plans
Reviewing plan with key stakeholders to finalize and distribute 

Step 4: Strategy and Plan Development
Validate that the recovery times that you have stated in your plan are obtainable and meet the objectives that are stated in the BIA. They should easily be available and readily accessible to staff, especially if and when a disaster were to happen. In the development phase, it's important to incorporate many perspectives from various staff and all departments to help map the overall company feel and organizational focus. Once the plan is developed, we recommend that you have an executive or management team review and sign off on the overall plan.

Step 5: Plan Testing & Maintenance
The final critical element of a business continuity plan is to ensure that it is tested and maintained on a regular basis. This includes:
Conducting periodic table top and simulation exercises to ensure key stakeholders are comfortable with the plan steps
Executing bi-annual plan reviews
Performing annual Business Impact Assessments

QUESTION 561
A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is evaluating the dangers involved in deploying a new ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system for the company. The CISO categorizes the system, selects the controls that apply to the system, implements the controls, and then assesses the success of the controls before authorizing the system. 
Which of the following is the CISO using to evaluate the environment for this new ERP system?

A. The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis 
B. CIS Critical Security Controls
C. NIST Risk Management Framework 
D. ISO 27002

Answer: C 

NIST SP 800-37, “Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations,” covers the Risk Management
Framework (RMF). While U.S. federal government agencies must adopt the RMF, many private sector organizations adopt it as well. RMF provides organizations with a seven-step process to identify and mitigate risks. The seven steps are: 

> Prepare
> Categorize 
> Select security controls
> Implement security controls
> Assess security controls. 
> Authorize information systems
> Monitor security controls

ISO/IEC 27002 - Security techniques - Code of practice for information security controls.


The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis focuses on understanding the attacker by analyzing four key components of every intrusion event. These four components are: 

Adversary. Adversaries can be identified by email addresses, handles used in online forums,  memberships in advanced persistent threat groups, and other identifiers. 

Capabilities. Capabilities refer to the malware, exploits, and other hacker tools used in the intrusion.  

Infrastructure. The infrastructure refers to the Internet domain names, email addresses, and IP addresses used by the adversary.  

Victim. Victims can be identified by their names, email addresses, or network identifiers.

Which of the following will increase cryptographic security?

A. High data entropy
B. Algorithms that require less computing power 
C. Longer key longevity
D. Hashing

Answer: A

Entropy is a measure of disorder. A plaintext will usually exhibit low entropy as it represents a message in a human language or programming language or data structure. The plaintext must be ordered for it to be intelligible to a person, computer processor, or database. One of the requirements of a strong cryptographic algorithm is to produce a disordered ciphertext. Put another way, the ciphertext must exhibit a high level of entropy. If any elements of order from the plaintext persist, it will make the ciphertext vulnerable to cryptanalysis, and the algorithm can be shown to be weak.

Which of the following components can be used to consolidate and forward inbound Internet traffic to multiple cloud environments though a single firewall?

A. Transit gateway 
B. Cloud hot site 
C. Edge computing 
D. DNS sinkhole

Answer: A

Traditionally, Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) can be interconnected using peering relationships and connected with on-premises networks using VPN gateways. These one-to-one VPC peering relationships can quickly become difficult to manage, especially if each VPC must interconnect in a mesh-like structure. A transit gateway is a simpler means of managing these interconnections. Essentially, a transit gateway is a virtual router that handles routing between the subnets in each attached VPC and any attached VPN gateways (aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway).

QUESTION 588
During an incident response, an analyst applied rules to all inbound traffic on the border firewall and implemented ACLs on each critical server. Following an investigation, the company realizes it is still vulnerable because outbound traffic is not restricted, and the adversary is able to maintain a presence in the network. In which of the following stages of the Cyber Kill Chain is the adversary currently operating?

A. Reconnaissance
B. Command and control 
C. Actions on objective 
D. Exploitation

Answer: B

The Lockheed Martin kill chain identifies the following phases:

1. Reconnaissance—in this stage the attacker determines what methods to use to complete the phases of the attack 
and gathers information about the target's personnel, computer systems, and supply chain.

2. Weaponization—the attacker couples payload code that will enable access with exploit code that will use a vulnerability to execute on the target system.

3. Delivery—the attacker identifies a vector by which to transmit the weaponized code to the target environment, such as via an email attachment or on a USB drive.

4. Exploitation—the weaponized code is executed on the target system by this mechanism. For example, a phishing email may trick the user into running the code, while a drive-by-download would execute on a vulnerable system without user intervention.

5. Installation—this mechanism enables the weaponized code to run a remote access tool and achieve persistence on the target system.

6. Command and control (C2 or C&C)—the weaponized code establishes an outbound channel to a remote server that can 
then be used to control the remote access tool and possibly download additional tools to progress the attack. 

7. Actions on objectives—in this phase, the attacker typically uses the access he has achieved to covertly collect information from target systems and transfer it to a remote system (data exfiltration). An attacker may have other goals or motives, however.

QUESTION 590
An application owner reports suspicious activity on an internal financial application from various internal users within the past 14 days. A security analyst notices the following:

- Financial transactions were occurring during irregular time frames and outside of business hours by unauthorized users.
- Internal users in question were changing their passwords frequently during that time period. 
- A jump box that several domain administrators use to connect to remote devices was recently compromised.
- The authentication method used in the environment is NTLM.

Which of the following types of attacks is MOST likely being used to gain unauthorized access?

A. Pass-the-hash 
B. Brute-force
C. Directory traversal 
D. Replay

Answer: A

In a pass the hash attack, the attacker discovers the hash of the user’s password and then uses it to log on to the system as the user. Any authentication protocol that passes the hash over the network in an unencrypted format is susceptible to this attack. It has been widely associated with Microsoft LAN Manager (LM) and NT LAN Manager (NTLM), two older security protocols used to authenticate Microsoft clients. However, this attack has enjoyed success against other protocols, such as Kerberos.

An attacker was eavesdropping on a user who was shopping online. The attacker was able to spoof the IP address associated with the shopping site. Later, the user received an email regarding the credit card statement with unusual purchases. Which of the following attacks took place?

A. On-path attack
B. Protocol poisoning 
C. Domain hijacking 
D. Bluejacking

Answer: A

Attackers can also take advantage of the lack of security in low-level data link protocols to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A MitM or on-path attack is where the threat actor gains a position between two hosts, and transparently captures,
monitors, and relays all communication between the hosts. An on-path attack could also be used to covertly modify the traffic.

Software as a service (SaaS) is a different model of provisioning software applications. Rather than purchasing software licenses for a given number of seats, a business would access software hosted on a supplier's servers on a pay-as-you go or lease arrangement (on-demand). Virtual infrastructure allows developers to provision on-demand applications much more quickly than previously. The applications can be developed and tested in the cloud without the need to test and deploy on client computers. Examples include Microsoft Office 365 (microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise), Salesforce (salesforce.com), and Google G Suite (gsuite. google.com).

Platform as a service (PaaS) provides resources somewhere between SaaS and IaaS. A typical PaaS solution would provide servers and storage network infrastructure (as per IaaS) but also provide a multi-tier web application/database platform on top.
This platform could be based on Oracle or MS SQL or PHP and MySQL. Examples include Oracle Database (oracle.com/database), Microsoft Azure SQL Database (azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database), and Google App Engine (cloud.google.com/ appengine). As distinct from SaaS though, this platform would not be configured to actually do anything. 
Your own developers would have to create the software (the CRM or e‑commerce application) that runs using the platform. 
The service provider would be responsible for the integrity and availability of the platform components, but you would be responsible for the security of the application you created on the platform.

QUESTION 596
All security analyst’s workstations at a company have network access to a critical server VLAN. The information security manager wants to further enhance the controls by requiring that all access to the secure VLAN be authorized only from a given single location. Which of the following will the information security manager MOST likely implement?

A. A forward proxy server 
B. A jump server
C. A reverse proxy server 
D. A stateful firewall server

Answer: B

One of the challenges of managing hosts that are exposed to the Internet, such as in a DMZ or cloud virtual network, is to provide administrative access to the servers and appliances located within it. On the one hand, a link is necessary; on the other, the
administrative interface could be compromised and exploited as a pivot point into the rest of the network. Consequently, the management hosts permitted to access administrative interfaces on hosts in the secure zone must be tightly controlled.
Configuring and auditing this type of control when there are many different servers operating in the zone is complex
.
One solution to this complexity is to add a single administration server, or jump server, to the secure zone. The jump server only runs the necessary administrative port and protocol (typically SSH or RDP). Administrators connect to the jump server then use the jump server to connect to the admin interface on the application server. The application server's admin interface has a single entry in its ACL (the jump server) and denies connection attempts from any other hosts.
