An SSID is a unique identifier (a.k.a. wireless network name) for a WLAN. Wireless networks advertise their presence by regularly broadcasting SSID in a special packet called beacon frame. In wireless networks with disabled security features, knowing the network SSID is enough to get access to the network. SSID also pinpoints the wireless router that acts as a WAP. Wireless routers from the same manufacturer are frequently configured with default (well-known) SSID names. Since multiple devices with the same SSID displayed on the list of available networks create confusion and encourage accidental access by unauthorized users (applies to networks that lack security), changing the default SSID is a recommended practice.

One of the ways to prevent data recovery from a storage drive is to overwrite its contents. The data overwriting technique is used by drive wipe utilities which might employ different methods (including multiple overwriting rounds) to decrease the likelihood of data retrieval.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a UDP-based, application layer protocol used in network management systems to monitor network-attached devices. SNMP is typically integrated into most modern network infrastructure devices such as routers, bridges, switches, servers, printers, copiers, fax machines, and other network-attached devices. An SNMP-managed network comprises three essential components: a managed device, a network-management software module that resides on a managed device (Agent), and a Network Management Station (NMS), which runs applications responsible for monitoring and controlling managed devices, as well as collecting SNMP information from Agents. The manager receives notifications (Traps and InformRequests) on UDP port 162, while the SNMP Agent receives requests on UDP port 161.
True (Correct)

Firewall rules are evaluated based on their order of precedence. Rules at the top of the list take precedence over rules further down the list. Once a matching rule is found, no further evaluation of subsequent rules occurs. The "implicit deny" policy on a firewall is a common default behavior in which any traffic that does not explicitly match any of the configured allow rules is automatically denied or blocked. In other words, if a packet does not meet the criteria of any allow rule, the default behavior of the firewall is to deny the traffic.
